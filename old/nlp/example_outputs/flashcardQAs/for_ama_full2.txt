 Longevity supplements and drugs
1. What are your thoughts on resveratrol for increasing lifespan? - Resveratrol might have some positive effects on energy levels, but it doesn't seem to increase human lifespan at the present time, with most of the debate surrounding its potential benefits being anecdotal or in animal studies.
2. Do you take any supplements for longevity? - Yes, I take 500-800 milligrams of NR and NMN every day, mainly for their impact on cellular energy and vascular function.
3. What about metformin or berberine? Are they effective in extending lifespan? - Although there's some debate about their potential benefits, I don't take either supplement due to a lack of direct evidence supporting their use for increasing lifespan, and because of the possible side effects associated with them.
4. What are your thoughts on NAD infusions? - They can be uncomfortable but provide an increase in energy after completing, however, they are not something I would recommend as a foundation for longevity since there's no direct evidence linking it to increased lifespan and other factors like sleep, exercise, nutrition, and stress management should be prioritized.
5. How do you think the NAD pathway can benefit our health? - The NAD pathway is being researched extensively for its potential effects on mental health, physical performance, and aging processes within cells, which could lead to better energy levels and perhaps other health benefits when taken safely at appropriate dosages in the context of a comprehensive lifestyle.
