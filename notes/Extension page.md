YOUR DATA:
When installing you can read: "it can read and change all your data on all websites"
It means that you can use it to save all your data e.g. passwords. 
As per the Privacy Policy when you use it, it saves: the page title, url, and whatever you see on the right.
And all changing it does is the underlining on the page.
The extensions are reviewed to check that they do what they claim.
