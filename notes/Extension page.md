â„¹ About your data:
When installing you can read: "it can read and change all your data on all websites"
The only information that ever gets uploaded (when signed in):
* When you use it to save:
	* Open page address
	* Saved highlight/quote - what's visible in the sidebar
	* Timestamp
The extension also keeps track the currently open tab for each window - to update the sidebar as you navigate - but doesn't save or upload that data.
