I'd never want to go back to bookmarks, so if you're anything like me I think you won't too;)

I never remembered what was "inside" bookmarks and why I saved them, and it was hard to find anything.
For example: I would go to google, search until I found what I needed and only then see that I had the page bookmarked already.

I made Faros to fix this.

Instead of bookmarking whole page, you save a highlighted snippet from it. When you open your save you go right back to the snippet in the page.

Save:
➣ summaries - to remember what the page is about
➣ facts & figures - for quick reference
➣ sentence you finished reading at - to resume reading longer articles


## V2

When you're browsing and come across something you'd like to revisit later you have a few options: keeping the tab open, bookmarks, copying the url to notion/obsidian etc. 

Faros is an extension designed to make revisiting the easiest possible.
You save both the URL and a highlighted snippet from the page.
So you can:
➣ remember better what the page is about
➣ search by text
➣ get back to exactly where you were in text - no need to scroll 

They're also presented as a scrollable feed with most recent saves first - so you can:
➣ remind yourself what you saved recently
➣ organise your saves with tags later

Moreover, you can copy a link to your highlight and share it, or paste into Notion, Obsidian, etc.

I've been using it since February and really liked it, so I hope you'll like it too.


ℹ️ About your data:
When installing you can read: "it can read and change all your data on all websites"
The only information that ever gets uploaded (when signed in) when you use it to save:
➣ Open page address
➣ Saved highlight/quote - what's visible in the sidebar
➣ Timestamp
➣ Debug info e.g. errors

The extension also keeps track the currently open tab for each window - to update the sidebar as you navigate - but doesn't save or upload that data.
