I'd never want to go back to bookmarks, so if you're anything like me I think you won't too;)

I never remembered what was "inside" bookmarks and why I saved them, and it was hard to find anything.
For example: I would go to google, search until I found what I needed and only then see that I had the page bookmarked already.

I made Faros to fix this.

Instead of bookmarking whole page, you save a highlighted snippet from it. When you open your save you go right back to the snippet in the page.

Save:
➣ summaries - to remember what the page is about
➣ facts & figures - for quick reference
➣ sentence you finished reading at - to resume reading longer articles


ℹ About your data:
When installing you can read: "it can read and change all your data on all websites"
The only information that ever gets uploaded (when signed in):
* When you use it to save:
	* Open page address
	* Saved highlight/quote - what's visible in the sidebar
	* Timestamp
The extension also keeps track the currently open tab for each window - to update the sidebar as you navigate - but doesn't save or upload that data.
