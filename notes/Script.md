I can start with the problem [[business knowledge 2hrsxxmin]] 
Reading online overwhelming? - no!

What's different to bookmarks is that you save a piece of text along with the  

Faros is kinda like bookmarks, but you save snippets of text from pages instead of just pages.
Here's what it looks like:
* You highlight something
* Save from context menu (right click) or keyboard shortcut
* Find your saves in a dashboard
* Double click it to open
Here's what makes it better than bookmarks:
* Searching by text is very easy
* Easy to remember why you saved something
* Don't need to scroll over the page

* So I have 3 ideas

Faros is an app to use saved highlights like bookmarks.
So where a bookmark saves a link to the page - here you save a link to the snippet you highlight.
It works like this:
* Highlight a piece of text
* Save from the context menu (right click) or with a keyboard shortcut
* Find your saves on the dashboard
Because the snippet is there you can remember what it's about and why you saved it.

* Double click it to open??

based on [[Wording#V4]]
If reading online you come across stuff you want to be able to go back to later, then Faros is the perfect extension to use.
Highlight a sentence or two, you find the most important,
and save it with the context menu, or a keyboard shortcut,
which defaults to Alt + D or Option + D on mac.
(make a second one - Adrian didnt know)
Saves go to the dashboard, with most recent first, so you don't forget to revisit them.
And a double click takes you right back to where you were in text, both from the dashboard, and in the sidebar. 
%% no pin & archive options? only useful once you have like 20 of them... %%
Use tags for categories. at the top:
A click toggles it, and a double click, makes it the unique - one selected. 
%% The exact same goes for websites.  %%
You also get a better text search:
Like I can type dino and get the extinction, 
Because it's obvious it's the important info.
