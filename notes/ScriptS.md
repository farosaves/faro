Faros is a browser extension for (managing) online reading.
It helps you save and revisit pages.
Let's say you want to save this page. 


You use it instead of bookmarks.
Say I'm on this page and want to get back to it later.

All saves go to my dashboard, which looks like this:
So imagine if I had a bookmark titled "Scutigera coleoptrata"- a week later - I'd have no clue what that is - here with this tagline I'll remember what it was in a month.
