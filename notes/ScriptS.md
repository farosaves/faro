remember the girl texting guy - Even mentioning that saving is important can be helpful.

Faros is a browser extension for (managing) online reading.
It helps you save and revisit pages.
Let's say you want to save this page. / Let's take this page.
Before you save, you ask yourself, why would I ever care about it?
I heard about Karakorum as the capital of the mongol empire.
Highlight this piece of information, save it.

It goes to the dashboard.

In a month I'll probably forget what it's called, let alone whether it's spelt with a Q or a K. So if I bookmarked it, I'd need to go through all my bookmarks, at least within a folder, and open them one by one to see if that was it.
But I saved it with faros, so to find the mongol capital, I can just type mongol capital. 


So if I wanted to go find the Mongol capital that I saw, I'd just google for it again.
Which makes bookmarking kind of useless.









You use it instead of bookmarks.
Say I'm on this page and want to get back to it later. 
Instead of bookmarking a whole page, I first ask myself - why do I care about this page?
So here it was about the centipede with developed eyes.
So I highlight and save this sentence for reference.
All saves go to my dashboard, which looks like this:
So imagine if I had a bookmark titled "Scutigera coleoptrata"- a week later - I'd have no clue what that is - here with this tagline I'll remember what it was in a month.
