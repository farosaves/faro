* Find all saves on your dashboard. They come most-recent-first by default, so easy to pick up your reading where you left off.

Faro is a browser extension that combines a web highlighter and a bookmark manager. 

With Faro, when saving a page, you highlight a sentence to act as a tagline. Usually it's just the sentence you read that made you want to save it, so 0 extra effort required.

All saves appear on your dashboard. They come most-recent-first by default, so you don't forget what you saved most recently. You can also pin & archive to further manipulate it.

They are organized with tags. Since you're reminded what you saved and why, you can do it later. It's much easier to manage your saves after some time, compared to bookmarks.
