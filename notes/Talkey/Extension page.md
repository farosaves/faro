I'd never want to go back to bookmarks, so if you're anything like me I think you won't too;)

I never remembered what was "inside" bookmarks and why I saved them, and it was hard to find anything.
For example: I would go to google, search until I found what I needed and only then see that I had the page bookmarked already.

I made Faros to fix this.

Instead of bookmarking whole page, you save a highlighted snippet from it. When you open your save you go right back to the snippet in the page.

Save:
➣ summaries - to remember what the page is about
➣ facts & figures - for quick reference
➣ sentence you finished reading at - to resume reading longer articles


## V2

When you're browsing and come across something you'd like to revisit later you have a few options: keeping the tab open, bookmarks, copying the url to notion/obsidian etc. 

Faros is an extension designed to make revisiting the easiest possible.
You save both the URL and a highlighted snippet from the page.
So you can:
➣ remember better what the page is about
➣ search by text
➣ get back to exactly where you were in text - no need to scroll 

They're also presented as a scrollable feed with most recent saves first - so you can:
➣ remind yourself what you saved recently
➣ organize your saves with tags later

Moreover, you can copy a link to your highlight and share it, or paste into Notion, Obsidian, etc.

I've been using it since February and really liked it, so I hope you'll like it too.


ℹ️ About your data:
When installing you can read: "it can read and change all your data on all websites"
The only information that ever gets uploaded (when signed in) when you use it to save:
➣ Open page address
➣ Saved highlight/quote - what's visible in the sidebar
➣ Timestamp
➣ Debug info e.g. errors

The extension also keeps track the currently open tab for each window - to update the sidebar as you navigate - but doesn't save or upload that data.

Chaos in your bookmarks? Can't find what you want? They end up gathering dust? Or you don't even try and end up with 100s of open tabs?

Faro is made to fix that! Use it to save pages.

The main difference is that when saving, you highlight a sentence to act as a tagline. 

Super simple but fixes most problems with normal bookmarks - check out the screenshots!

➣ remember easily what the page is about
➣ search by text
➣ get back to where you were in text without scrolling

They're presented in a dashboard with a scrollable Pinterest-like feed.
So you can:
➣ check what you saved recently
➣ organize your saves with tags later

Also:
➣ export to bookmarks to keep them if you uninstall Faro
➣ copy links to highlights and share them or paste into Notion, Obsidian, etc.

## V7 
Chaos in your bookmarks? Can't find what you want? They end up gathering dust? Or you don't even try and end up with 100s of open tabs?

Faro is made to fix that! Use it to save pages.

When saving, you highlight a sentence to act as a tagline. It helps you remember what the page is about and why you saved it. Usually it's just the one you read that made you want to save, so 0 extra effort required.

All saves appear on your dashboard. They come most-recent-first by default, so you don't forget what you recently saved. You can pick up your reading where you left off - no need for a separate reading list. You can also pin & archive to further arrange it.

Organize them with tags. Since you're reminded what you saved and why, you can do it later. It's MUCH easier to manage your saves, compared to bookmarks. It includes nested tags (like in Obsidian). 

Clicking a save takes you right back to your highlight - useful for longer articles, esp. when you left reading partway through.

Also:
➣ export to bookmarks to keep them if you uninstall Faro
➣ copy links to highlights and share them or paste into Notion, Obsidian, etc.
