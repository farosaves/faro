I can start with the problem [[business knowledge 2hrsxxmin]] 
Reading online overwhelming? - no!

What's different to bookmarks is that you save a piece of text along with the  

Faros is kinda like bookmarks, but you save snippets of text from pages instead of just pages.
Here's what it looks like:
* You highlight something
* Save from context menu (right click) or keyboard shortcut
* Find your saves in a dashboard
* Double click it to open
Here's what makes it better than bookmarks:
* Searching by text is very easy
* Easy to remember why you saved something
* Don't need to scroll over the page

#### Is it a promotional or introductory video
* So I have 3 ideas

Faros is an app to use saved highlights like bookmarks.
So where a bookmark saves a link to the page - here you save a link to the snippet you highlight.
It works like this:
* Highlight a piece of text
* Save from the context menu (right click) or with a keyboard shortcut
* Find your saves on the dashboard
Because the snippet is there you can remember what it's about and why you saved it.

* Double click it to open??

based on [[Wording#V4]]
1. If reading online you come across stuff you want to be able revisit later, then Faros is the perfect extension to use.
2. You go to a website and highlight a sentence or two
3. which you find the most important, then save it with the context menu, or a keyboard shortcut,
4. which defaults to Alt + D or Option + D, on a mac.
(make a second one - Adrian didnt know)
5. Saves go to the dashboard, with the most recent first, so you don't forget to revisit them.
6. And a double click takes you right back to where you were in text, both from the dashboard, and in the sidebar. 
%% no pin & archive options? only useful once you have like 20 of them... %%
7. Use tags for categories, and here at the top:
8. A click toggles it, and a double click, makes it the unique - one selected. 
%% The exact same goes for websites.  %%
9. You also get a better text search,
10. Cause you find keywords from the highlighted snippets
11. Like hop, or dino here
12. Find it on chrome webstore

dem moves:
1. Faros landing page
2. Go to jerboa, highlight desert kangaroo

If you're learning or researching a lot online, you have to save a lot of pages for later.
If you're like me, you either have a mess in your bookmarks or hundreds of open tabs.
Maybe you're thinking - I should be better organized. 
Nah, it wouldn't help much here, 'cause it just shouldn't be so hard in the first place.
What you should is having a better *tool*.
Faro is a tool for this. Don't know if it's the best one, but it *is* the simplest one.

Do you have a mess in your bookmarks or hundreds of open tabs?
Maybe you're thinking - I should be better organized. 

It's not you - you just haven't found the right tool for you yet.
Faro, hopefully, can be the one.
It's the simplest tool for managing online reading.

But what you need is a better tool and much better one at that.
Presenting Faro, the simplest solution for managing online reading.

Two features set it apart.
One: A scrollable feed with all your saves(, a bit like Pinterest).
With taglines for your saves so you remember them.
Two: A web highlighter, that lets you save a piece of the page as tagline.
For example: Imagine you want to save this page. You find it interesting that it doesn't need to drink, you highlight and save it as you read it.
Then, months pass by, and you want to find: the animal that doesn't need to *drink* in the *desert*. And you're able to find it - just like this.
The remaining organization essentials, are standard, but solid. Pinning... archiving... and tags... including nested tags. 
Here's the kicker you can apply them *later* - because you'll still remember what you saved and why.
There's also undo and redo making it safe to experiment...
And everything gets immediately synced with the cloud if you're logged in.
