**what we do**
Faro is a Chrome extension that's a cross between a bookmark manager and a web highlighter. 
You save pages with highlights that act as tag lines.

2. Here's why it's hard/hasn't been done yet
So there's raindrop and web-highlights - both can be used for this purpose. But Faro is completely designed around treating your highlight as a tag line for the saved page.
3. Here's why it's needed/why it matters
If you forget and lose pages you saved, you can miss out on like 50%? of your browsing. Given how much time people (like me) spend on it, it's a real shame.
4. Here are the people who will need it (and how they're currently solving it)
Anyone that browses a lot - we're looking for a more specific initial niche to target - either with bookmarks, managers like pocket etc.
5. Here's why we're the ones to build it
I (the founder) do a lot of reading, both as a passion and profession, so I save around 50 items per week and for me the problem was so bad it was worth building it even if it's not commercially successful.
6. Here's how it works
Once you save a page with highlighted tag line, they go to a dashboard.
There you have cards showing the page title and the highlight. They come most recent first, so you can pick up your reading where you left off.
You organize them with tags - including Obsidian-inspired nested tags).
7. Here's how big the market can be
The limit is mostly by peoples willingness to use browser extension - going by password manager usage, you'd expect up to 10 million users.

I used to bookmark much fewer pages that I wanted to, because it'd get difficult to keep track of them. 
I find around 50 potentially useful pages per week (i.e. 2500/year), so I made a tool to make it manageable.

Using it, you basically highlight a snippet when saving a page. And later you organize them with tags, including nested tags. 

I'd like to get some feedback from you, so I made a demo page that you don't need to sign up nor download the extension for.



Notably it's the only tool that doesn't allow you save pages without snippets.
