Save & organize snippets - use like bookmarks

**what is the wording for??**
Instead of bookmarking a whole page, you save a fragment/piece/snippet of text. And when you open your save you go back to that fragment.
Makes it easier to remember what's "in" your save and why you saved it.

General problem: 
You're reading something on the web and go hmm interesting.
<!-- But if you close the tab you don't know if you'll ever -->
But the moment you close the tab it may be gone forever.
You can bookmark it, but if you forget why you bookmarked it, you probably won't open it to try to remember.
* if you see a bookmark not remembering why you have it

Benefits:
* text search
* remembering why
* don't need to scroll

Normally you'd:
* keep tabs open
* browse history
* use bookmarks
* re-google (and click purple links)

Show HN: Chrome extension for saving pages - web clipper meets bookmark manager

I was working on an AI flashcard app and in the card browser I added a functionality to open the page. I've started using it for saving pages (like bookmarks), and it worked way better. Ended up with just saving highlighted text, no AI now.

When reading online there's cool stuff you find, it's nice to be able to go back to it later.
You go to a website find something interesting, highlight one sentence and then you just save it.
It goes to a dashboard, most recent goes first, so it doesn't get buried like bookmarks do tend..
to. You attend to it, whenever you're ready, there're a few ways to help you remembering

Pin, archive, tag, double-click takes you back,I don't mean to brag, but it's cool as fuck
(tu chyba nic nie zrymuje z excellent, to moze wyjebie) did I mention text search it's an excellent
way to find a save, saving your time, sure it works offline, you don't need to sign
up, at least to try it out, then you get back, up in the cloud

(tutaj jesli dorzuce 2wers to zrobie pelen loop zeby  bylo bardziej tiktokable)
that's all I got in store for the presentation, faros chrome webstore should now be your next station


(dont think so)

#### V5
It helps you stay on top of online reading - you save sentences from pages to go back to them later.
Chrome ext for staying on top of online reading - highlight bookmarks / web clipper meets bookmark manager
Online reading total recall ?

That helps with online reading. Save anything you've read online to get back to it later.
I guess no [comparison with bookmarks](http://localhost:5173/notes/fe3327f3-7639-49eb-a7ed-13c8122667d9) %% http://farosapp.com/notes/fe3327f3-7639-49eb-a7ed-13c8122667d9 doesnt work???? %%

It's about connecting the dots so you have to connect them yourself but it's easier when you have them in one place.

### V6
#### landing page
**tagline** better than bookmarks / never use bookmarks again
* ***Save online reading - one sentence at a time**
* Use it like bookmarks, but with highlighting a sentence that describes what the page is about.
* A better way to save all the cool stuff you find online - (by making it easier to) remember what you saved and why.
* Save online reading / never forget what you saved and why

Manifest: Save online reading - bookmarks with highlights

Do you have chaos in your bookmarks? Can't find what you want? They end up gathering dust?

This extension is made to fix that!
You use it instead of bookmarks to save pages.

The main difference is that when saving a page, you highlight a sentence on it to act as a tagline. 

It's simple but fixes most issues with normal bookmarks.

For example, you can:
➣ remember better what the page is about (by only reading 1 sentence)
➣ search by text
➣ get back to where you were in text without scrolling

They're presented in a dashboard with a scrollable Pinterest-like feed - so you can:
➣ remind yourself what you saved recently
➣ organize your saves with tags later

Also:
➣ export to bookmarks to keep them if you uninstall Faro
➣ copy links to highlights and share them or paste into Notion, Obsidian, etc.

### V8
Landing page WIP: 
* Ditch bookmark chaos and start saving pages with highlights.
* Remember better what the page is about with a single sentence highlight
* View your saves in a scrollable Pinterest-like feed, and organize them with tags later
* Say goodbye to the chaos of bookmarks. Save online pages with highlighted taglines for easy retrieval.

### What is the purpose of your extension? Describe the value that it provides to Chrome users

The purpose of Faro is to help Chrome users manage their saved pages more effectively, reducing clutter and making it easier to find what they need. It allows users to save pages with a highlighted sentence that serves as a tagline, to easily remember why they saved the page in the first place.

This makes it easy to e.g. update tags later, removes the need for a separate reading list, and allows saving longer articles multiple times when they have multiple points worth remembering and going back to.


Saving articles for later: Highlight a key sentence and save the page to easily find and return to it later.
Organizing research: Use tags to categorize and structure your saves, making it easy to find related pages and keep your research organized.
Saving inspiration and ideas: Capture the essence of a page with a highlighted sentence and easily find it later for inspiration or reference.


4. **Sharing and collaborating**: Export saves to bookmarks or copy links to highlights to share with others.
