Save & organize snippets - use like bookmarks

**what is the wording for??**
Instead of bookmarking a whole page, you save a fragment/piece/snippet of text. And when you open your save you go back to that fragment.
Makes it easier to remember what's "in" your save and why you saved it.

General problem: 
You're reading something on the web and go hmm interesting.
<!-- But if you close the tab you don't know if you'll ever -->
But the moment you close the tab it may be gone forever.
You can bookmark it, but if you forget why you bookmarked it, you probably won't open it to try to remember.
* if you see a bookmark not remembering why you have it

Benefits:
* text search
* remembering why
* don't need to scroll

Normally you'd:
* keep tabs open
* browse history
* use bookmarks
* re-google (and click purple links)

Show HN: Chrome extension for saving links - bookmark manager ⨯ web highlighter



I was working on an AI flashcard app and in the card browser I added a functionality to open the page. Then I've randomly started using it for saving pages (like bookmarks), and it worked way better. Removed the AI, and now it's just saving the highlighted text to be the tagline.

So it works because a generic tagline, like page description, is usually not specific enough. But writing a full note for each save would be too much effort. So highlighting the snippet is the best compromise here - it's just enough context to remember what the page is.

When reading online there's cool stuff you find, it's nice to be able to go back to it later.
You go to a website find something interesting, highlight one sentence and then you just save it.
It goes to a dashboard, most recent goes first, so it doesn't get buried like bookmarks do tend..
to. You attend to it, whenever you're ready, there're a few ways to help you remembering

Pin, archive, tag, double-click takes you back,I don't mean to brag, but it's cool as fuck
(tu chyba nic nie zrymuje z excellent, to moze wyjebie) did I mention text search it's an excellent
way to find a save, saving your time, sure it works offline, you don't need to sign
up, at least to try it out, then you get back, up in the cloud

#### V5
It helps you stay on top of online reading - you save sentences from pages to go back to them later.

Online reading total recall ?

That helps with online reading. Save anything you've read online to get back to it later.
I guess no [comparison with bookmarks](http://localhost:5173/notes/fe3327f3-7639-49eb-a7ed-13c8122667d9) %% http://farosapp.com/notes/fe3327f3-7639-49eb-a7ed-13c8122667d9 doesnt work???? %%

It's about connecting the dots so you have to connect them yourself but it's easier when you have them in one place.

Manifest: Save online reading - bookmarks with highlights

Do you have chaos in your bookmarks? Can't find what you want? They end up gathering dust?

This extension is made to fix that!
You use it instead of bookmarks to save pages.

The main difference is that when saving a page, you highlight a sentence on it to act as a tagline. 

It's simple but fixes most issues with normal bookmarks.

For example, you can:
➣ remember better what the page is about (by only reading 1 sentence)
➣ search by text
➣ get back to where you were in text without scrolling

They're presented in a dashboard with a scrollable Pinterest-like feed - so you can:
➣ remind yourself what you saved recently
➣ organize your saves with tags later

Also:
➣ export to bookmarks to keep them if you uninstall Faro
➣ copy links to highlights and share them or paste into Notion, Obsidian, etc.

### V8
Landing page WIP: 
* Ditch bookmark chaos and start saving pages with highlights.
* Remember better what the page is about with a single sentence highlight
* View your saves in a scrollable Pinterest-like feed, and organize them with tags later
* Say goodbye to the chaos of bookmarks. Save online pages with highlighted taglines for easy retrieval.

### What is the purpose of your extension? Describe the value that it provides to Chrome users

The purpose of Faro is to help Chrome users manage their saved pages more effectively, reducing clutter and making it easier to find what they need. It allows users to save pages with a highlighted sentence that serves as a tagline, to easily remember why they saved the page in the first place.

This makes it easy to e.g. update tags later, removes the need for a separate reading list, and allows saving longer articles multiple times when they have multiple points worth remembering and going back to.


Saving articles for later: Highlight a key sentence and save the page to easily find and return to it later.
Organizing research: Use tags to categorize and structure your saves, making it easy to find related pages and keep your research organized.
Saving inspiration and ideas: Capture the essence of a page with a highlighted sentence and easily find it later for inspiration or reference.

Title: Faro - Save pages with highlighted tag lines - Bookmark manager ⨯ web highlighter

Another attempt at bookmark manager, I know... what makes this one is different is that you highlight a piece of the page to be a tagline for it. Raindrop supports optional highlights, but it's just one feature among many. Here all saves are with highlights, and the whole app is designed around it.

It works because a generic tagline, like a page description, is usually not specific enough. On the other hand, writing a full note for each save would be too much effort. So highlighting the snippet is the best compromise here - it's just enough context to remember the page.

I was working on an AI flashcard app and it had a card explorer. While working on it, I've repurposed the explorer as bookmarks alternative and here it is, ~completed.

You don't need to sign up, it will work 100% locally, an account is needed for sync. So if bookmark chaos or 100s of open tabs are your problem, please try it out :)

#### V 9.5 madewithsvelte
Yet another attempt at bookmark manager. What makes Faro different is that you highlight a piece of the page to be a tagline. It works because a generic tagline, like a page description, is not specific enough. But writing a full note for each save would be too much effort. So highlighting is the best compromise here - very little effort, but you remember saves 90% of the time.

Everything is done with Svelte. 
It's made as a monorepo with:
A shared folder of components used both by the web app and the extension.
A SvelteKit web app.
A Svelte+Vite extension with crxjs

Supabase is used for the backend.

### V9.6 sideproject
I made an extension for saving online reading. 

Faro is a tool for saving pages. I know there's plenty already.
What's unique here is that you highlight tag lines for saves - it helps you remember pages, and is much less effort than writing a note. 
Later, you can organize them with tags - you can nest tags like `tag/subTag` so it combines the best of tags and folders.

You don't need to sign up, it works 100% locally, an account is needed for sync. 

I'd love to get feedback. I built it for myself, and don't know yet what kind of people would be interested in it.

#### Again

I was working on an AI flashcard app and it had a card explorer. While working on it, I've started using the explorer instead of bookmarks. I liked it so much I thought some people might like it too, so here it is, ~completed.

It's really not catching on, though. Maybe the benefit of using it is hard to convey? It's the first time I have to market anything.

#### Again 

I'm surprised I thought it was a good idea

Anyone else in the same boat?

I wasn't intending on starting something, but I was solving my own problem and kinda kept polishing the product along the way.
I know that the space is crowded

## V10 show HN

I made a tool to save links instead of browser bookmarks

I know, it's yet another one. I'm surprised I ended up creating one myself. 
What happened is, I was working on an AI flashcard extension, which had a card explorer, and ended up using the explorer instead of bookmarks. So I got rid of all the AI and flashcards and ended up with this.

It worked well enough for me to keep using and polishing it over the course of 9 months, so now's the time to share it. Maybe some of you would find it useful too.
