Save & organize snippets - use like bookmarks

**what is the wording for??**
Instead of bookmarking a whole page, you save a fragment/piece/snippet of text. And when you open your save you go back to that fragment.
Makes it easier to remember what's "in" your save and why you saved it.

General problem: 
You're reading something on the web and go hmm interesting.
<!-- But if you close the tab you don't know if you'll ever -->
But the moment you close the tab it may be gone forever.
You can bookmark it, but if you forget why you bookmarked it, you probably won't open it to try to remember.
* if you see a bookmark not remembering why you have it

Benefits:
* text search
* remembering why
* don't need to scroll

Normally you'd:
* keep tabs open
* browse history
* use bookmarks
* re-google (and click purple links)
