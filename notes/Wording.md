Save & organize snippets - use like bookmarks

**what is the wording for??**
Instead of bookmarking a whole page, you save a fragment/piece/snippet of text. And when you open your save you go back to that fragment.
Makes it easier to remember what's "in" your save and why you saved it.

General problem: 
You're reading something on the web and go hmm interesting.
<!-- But if you close the tab you don't know if you'll ever -->
But the moment you close the tab it may be gone forever.
You can bookmark it, but if you forget why you bookmarked it, you probably won't open it to try to remember.
* if you see a bookmark not remembering why you have it

Benefits:
* text search
* remembering why
* don't need to scroll

Normally you'd:
* keep tabs open
* browse history
* use bookmarks
* re-google (and click purple links)

When you're reading online and come across something you'd like to be able to revisit later there's no really good option of saving it.
The extension is designed to make revisiting as easy as possible.

When reading online there's cool stuff you find, it's nice to be able to go back to it later.
You go to a website find something interesting, highlight one sentence and then you just save it.
It goes  to a dashboard, most recent goes first, so it doesn't get buried like bookmarks do tend..
to. You attend to it, whenever you're ready, there're a few ways to help you remembering

pin, archive, tag, double-click takes you back,I don't mean to brag, but it's cool as fuck
(tu chyba nic nie zrymuje z excellent, to moze wyjebie) did I mention text search it's an excellent
way to find a save, saving your time, sure it works offline, you don't need to sign
up, at least to try it out, then you get back, up in the cloud

(tutaj jesli dorzuce 2wers to zrobie pelen loop zeby  bylo bardziej tiktokable)

It helps you stay on top of online reading - you save sentences from pages to go back to them later.
Chrome ext for staying on top of online reading - highlight bookmarks / web clipper meets bookmark manager
Online reading total recall ?

That helps with online reading. Save anything you've read online to get back to it later.
I guess no [comparison with bookmarks](http://localhost:5173/notes/fe3327f3-7639-49eb-a7ed-13c8122667d9) %% http://farosapp.com/notes/fe3327f3-7639-49eb-a7ed-13c8122667d9 doesnt work???? %%

It's about connecting the dots so you have to connect them yourself but it's easier when you have them in one place.
