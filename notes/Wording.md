Save & organize snippets - use like bookmarks

**what is the wording for??**
Instead of bookmarking a whole page, you save a fragment/piece/snippet of text. And when you open your save you go back to that fragment.
Makes it easier to remember what's "in" your save and why you saved it.

General problem: 
You're reading something on the web and go hmm interesting.
<!-- But if you close the tab you don't know if you'll ever -->
But the moment you close the tab it may be gone forever.
You can bookmark it, but if you forget why you bookmarked it, you probably won't open it to try to remember.
* if you see a bookmark not remembering why you have it

Benefits:
* text search
* remembering why
* don't need to scroll

Normally you'd:
* keep tabs open
* browse history
* use bookmarks
* re-google (and click purple links)

When you're browsing and come across something you'd like to revisit later you have a few options: keeping the tab open, bookmarks, copying the url to notion/obsidian etc. 

Faros is an extension designed exactly to make revisiting the easiest possible.
You save both the URL and a highlighted snippet from the page.
So you can:
➣ remember better what the page is about
➣ search by text
➣ get back to exactly where you were in text - no need to scroll 

They're also presented as a scrollable feed with most recent saves first - so you can:
➣ remind yourself what you saved recently
➣ organise your saves with tags later

I've been using it since February myself and it's
