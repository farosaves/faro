### meetings only
* always have next steps ready
* 3 big questions
* Idea out of the question
* lol go around complements - they may want to get rid of you
	* *It makes sense esp when they don't have a reason to complement.*
* dont double down on lukewarm response
	* not that big a problem? *what other questions here would be useful?*
	* they can always be on a reserve list
* no generics
## ?
* Google - bits of code for phd students
	* *who could it be for me? - r&d people/teams?*
* Not asking is more of a failure than rejection
* if you imagine the future: if it failed - why? it if was successful - why? what happened? 
* enterprise sales tedious but stronger signal
* if problems not consistent - segment not narrow enough
	* so im building it for myself right - like when I was using pocket for my AI research
