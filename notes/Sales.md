* sell the sizzle - put yourself in their shoes
	* dont treat explaining the problem as a sunken cost ^ced47b
	* dont assume they know the problem I scarcely did
* understand the customer
	* so much easier to sell to people that need it
	* do you like them? perhaps for the first X people useful
* long term (over years) - not sure how much b2c

# Marketing
* 50 % wasted - experiment
* organic
	* facebook had single/in a relationship - someone updated and they'd talk
* branding
	* sounds silly to me - but it's about highlighting what is unique
* not a standalone thing
* apple is for creative people to have beauty in their life
	* how does creativity relate here?
* systems: do one well, not 5 dead social media links
	* do I prefer writing... or talking to camera
* MEANT TO BE FUN
# PR
* research journalist and write the whole article for them in their style - wow
* journalists usually post more on twitter than have followers
* starts with having one person having respect for you

## Analogy
 In coding a feature is - when done right - just a cherry on top of refactors, libraries and tools. Seems that in sales a deal is a cherry on top of communication, understanding and authenticity.
