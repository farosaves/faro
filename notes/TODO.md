- [x] identify which columns I want to have encrypted
	tags, highlights, user_note, snippet_uuid, serialised_highlight, prioritised, quote, url, source_id
- [x] create a new database table with part of the columns encrypted
- [ ] write an  encrypting, and decrypting functions that convert between the two row types

- [x] write a function to insert into Supabase log table
- [x] convert probably all log if error invocations to warn if error
- [x] revise the fun log invocations
- [ ] ðŸ”Žlogg - for all other cases
	- [ ] check if doing now what expecting
- [ ] also check one from warnLog etc
- [ ] Don't make all URLs externally connectable.
- [x] find out why the session option is being logged
- [ ] make signing up much easier
	So for example, I can ask for the email, then check if there's an account associated with it, and then show you the password prompt if there is.
	- [ ] Think more about what the flow should look like.
		1. submit your email 
		2. either give the password or click the sign up button.
## enc1
- [x] Make a table where I will store the keys.
- [x] generate some random encryption key with the proper format
- [x] insert that key into the table for my account
- [x] write a function that retrieves the key for the currently logged in user
- [x] add a flag in keys I guess, to mark if user agreed to password recovery
- [x] modify the sync go online function to require this flag
- [x] add a flag to mark that the key is derived from the password
- [ ] Modify sync go online to accept the password derived key

## interlude
- [x] Add a field for the referer.
- [x] Add to enc
## enc2
- [ ] Decide what to do with the IV.
- [ ] write an encrypting function that takes a key and converts a note row to a save row.
- [ ] Write an inverse function that also takes a key.
- [ ] Remember the next deployment should be like 0.2 and wait for approval so I deploy simultaneously.

## login page
- [x] Create two routes.
- [x] For now duplicate the code into both.
- [x] Remove the magic link option.
- [ ] Look at the set password page

## debug
Performance in the built-in dashboard to win the extension is much better.
An example of that is starring a save. 
One possible cause for that could be the layout within which the web app dashboard is presented.
Removed the flex but hasn't changed much.
I don't know if they can be batched in any better way.
