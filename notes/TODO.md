- [ ] Ctrl Z didnt work - seemingly deleted the note in the ext but appeared on website - what would a refresh do?

- [ ] virtual list
	- [x] first test
	- [ ] check if performance is due to this - i.e on a loaded vs emptyish account
	- [ ] if yes - consider going month by month 
	- [ ] if not - still, just not that urgent
- [ ] encryption
	- [x] identify which columns I want to have encrypted
		tags, highlights, user_note, snippet_uuid, serialised_highlight, prioritised, quote, url, source_id

		1. submit your email 
		2. either give the password or click the sign up button.
## enc1
- [x] Make a table where I will store the keys.
- [x] generate some random encryption key with the proper format
- [x] insert that key into the table for my account
- [x] write a function that retrieves the key for the currently logged in user
- [x] add a flag in keys I guess, to mark if user agreed to password recovery
- [x] add a flag to mark that the key is derived from the password
- [ ] modify the sync go online function to require this flag
- [ ] Modify sync go online to accept the password derived key

## interlude
- [x] Add a field for the referer.
- [x] Add to enc
- [x] see if hash links work on PubMed.

	a [push](https://dev.farosapp.com/notes/6b92d44f-cfa6-4257-a97a-34b58c2d65b6) notification when someone made new bookmarks elsewhere?

## bookmark sync
- [x] Change the current URL query param with theÂ "**fragment identifier**Â orÂ **anchor link**."

## enc2
- [ ] Decide what to do with the IV.

- [ ] Write an inverse function that also takes a key.
- [ ] Remember the next deployment should be like 0.2 and wait for approval so I deploy simultaneously.

## login page
- [x] Create two routes.
- [x] For now duplicate the code into both.
- [x] Remove the magic link option.
- [ ] Look at the set password page

## debug
Performance in the built-in dashboard within the extension is much better.
E.g. starring a save. 
Because of the layout within which the web app dashboard is presented?
Removed the flex - hasn't changed much.
I don't know if they can be batched in any better way.
## ideas
- [ ] Check out Mastodon, Blue Sky and so on for making accounts
- [ ] reach out to https://skyhook.be / https://west.io
- [ ] When I'm hovering over a section or title, perhaps I can bring all of starred, archived and neutral ones.
	It's because I can see one note and not remember that I may have more from the same website in the archive.
### support
- [ ] support prompt if anything not working???
- [ ] debug turn-on-able?

- [x] Improve dictation for writing my notes.
- [x] Learn to break up tasks better.


## special cases
- [ ] YouTube comments should save URL of the comment.
- [ ] Quora should save the shareable link in the bottom right corner.
- [ ] Reddit probably also just the comment url
