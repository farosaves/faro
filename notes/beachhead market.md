1. Medicine students / researchers
   * What kind of sources do they use? 
	   * pubmed
	   * anki, on this note
		   * for them remembering the cards and not the material is a problem - so extra cards that overlap would help https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/18mkcxc/how_often_do_you_edit_anking_cards/ 
		   * clozes so far seem to be more popular
		   * medical school deck is 21000 cards...
		   * btw [interesting requested feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschoolanki/comments/18nw9zn/compiling_anking_cards/) could we mby do clozes directly on top of article?..

		   #todo 
		   - [ ] pick a sample of cards
		   - [ ] see if the information is found on wikipedia
		   - [ ] see if linking is feasible
		   - [ ] to assess to what extent medial and wikipedia prioritisations synergise
    * Specifics
      * They have a predetermined set of topics they need to cover instead of requiring us to follow their interest and build it up on the fly
