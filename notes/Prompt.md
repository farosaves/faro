I'm making a Chrome extension called Faro, here's the Description from the Chrome Web Store page for context:
Manifest: Save online reading - bookmarks with highlights

Do you have chaos in your bookmarks? Can't find what you want? They end up gathering dust?

This extension is made to fix that!
You use it instead of bookmarks to save pages.

The main difference is that when saving a page, you highlight a sentence on it to act as a tagline. 

It's simple but fixes most issues with normal bookmarks.

For example you can:
➣ remember better what the page is about (by only reading 1 sentence)
➣ search by text
➣ get back to where you were in text without scrolling

They're presented in a dashboard with a scrollable Pinterest-like feed - so you can:
➣ remind yourself what you saved recently
➣ organize your saves with tags later

Also:
➣ export to bookmarks to keep them if you uninstall Faro
➣ copy links to highlights and share them or paste into Notion, Obsidian, etc.

I want to make a landing page for it with daisyUI and Tailwind CSS. 
The page already runs on sveltekit, has footer and navbar already, so I just need the root +page.svelte. 
What I need help with is the layout, I want it to be uncluttered when you first load the page, and then have more information about features etc as you scroll down.
Can you help me get started?
