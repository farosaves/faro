I'm making a Chrome extension and I'd like your help with making a meta description, can you give a few suggestions?
Here are the materials I have so far:
A script for my promotional video:
Faros - it's a browser extension that helps you stay on top of your online reading.
When you find something interesting, it makes it easy to get back to it later. 
What you do, is highlight a sentence or two, that are the most relevant to you, 
And save it with the context menu, or a keyboard shortcut.
Saves go to the dashboard, the most recent come first, so you won't forget about them.
A double click takes you right back to where you were in text, both in the dashboard, and in the sidebar.
You can organise them with tags, all of which are displayed at the top. Clicking toggles it, and double clicking makes it the only one active.
It's also easy to search by text, cause you find keywords in the highlighted snippets
When you're browsing and come across something you'd like to revisit later you have a few options: keeping the tab open, bookmarks, copying the url to notion/obsidian etc. 

Chrome webstore listing:
Faros is an extension designed to make revisiting the easiest possible.
You save both the URL and a highlighted snippet from the page.
So you can:
➣ remember better what the page is about
➣ search by text
➣ get back to exactly where you were in text - no need to scroll 

They're also presented as a scrollable feed with most recent saves first - so you can:
➣ remind yourself what you saved recently
➣ organise your saves with tags later

I've been using it since February and really liked it, so I hope you'll like it too.

ℹ️ About your data:
When installing you can read: "it can read and change all your data on all websites"
The only information that ever gets uploaded (when signed in) when you use it to save:
➣ Open page address
➣ Saved highlight/quote - what's visible in the sidebar
➣ Timestamp

The extension also keeps track the currently open tab for each window - to update the sidebar as you navigate - but doesn't save or upload that data.
