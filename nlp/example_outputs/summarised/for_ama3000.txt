Resveratrol and Longevity Supplementation

In this episode of the Huberman Lab podcast, Andrew Huberman discusses various supplements that claim to extend lifespan, particularly focusing on resveratrol. He states that there has been a lot of conjecture surrounding resveratrol but emphasizes that at present, it's highly unlikely that resveratrol directly increases an individual's lifespan. While grape seed extracts containing resveratrol may have some positive cellular effects, evidence supporting its ability to increase longevity is weak.

Huberman regularly consumes 400-800 milligrams of grape seed extract for improved vascular function and blood flow rather than expecting it to impact lifespan. He does not recommend grape seed extract as a primary tool for extending lifespan, but as part of an overall supplementation stack with low costs and minimal side effects.

Few years back, there was a surge in interest regarding NAD-related pathways for longevity enhancement through supplementation like NR (Nicotinamide Riboside) and NMN (Nicotinamide Mononucleotide). These substances are linked to cellular energetics, mitochondrial function, and the NAD pathway. Although Huberman has tried various ways of increasing NAD levels in his body through supplements like NR or NMN, or even intravenous infusions of NAD itself, he does not consume them for their potential impact on lifespan extension. Instead, he takes NR and NMN to maintain high mental and physical energy levels throughout the day.

In conclusion, while supplements like resveratrol or NAD pathway enhancers have been extensively explored for longevity benefits, current evidence is insufficient to claim that they directly extend lifespan in humans. Huberman suggests exploring these supplements for their potential positive effects rather than solely focusing on lifespan extension.
