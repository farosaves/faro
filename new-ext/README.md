I'm going to be changing the whole idea of my extension.

Currently there's a web app and an extension and items that are shared by both are in the shared project.

I want to get rid of the web app and make it extension only with only one project.

### Steps

1. Start with the new framework wxt
2. get the build and rudimentary test process running
